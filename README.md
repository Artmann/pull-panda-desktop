A delightful code review tool for the AI era.

## What is Pull Panda?

Pull Panda is a desktop app that makes reviewing GitHub pull requests faster and
more pleasant. In an era where AI is generating more code than ever, we believe
code review should be a smooth, focused experience rather than a chore.

- Authorize with your GitHub account
- See all PRs that need your attention in one place
- Review faster with a clean, modern interface
- Dark mode support with automatic system theme detection

## Features

### Dark Mode

Pull Panda supports both light and dark themes with automatic system theme
detection. You can:

- Toggle between light and dark mode using **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D**
- Let the app follow your system theme automatically
- Your theme preference persists across app restarts

Code blocks use the beautiful Catppuccin color schemes (Latte for light mode,
Mocha for dark mode) for syntax highlighting.
